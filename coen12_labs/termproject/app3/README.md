Assignment: 

Consider a  college holding records about its students, where each record contains two integer fields: ID and Age. Identify  the most  appropriate  data structuresso  that  the  Big-O  run  time forfrequent  operations  is optimized

Assume  a  new college that  is  expanding frequently  and dramatically  on  its  student  amount. This  leads  to  two consequences. First, accurately  estimating  the  total  number  of  students  is  extremely  difficult.  Second, frequent insertions and deletions are performed. In addition, the college frequently requirescalculatingthe largest age gap among  its  students. Assume  that  search  operations  are  not  performed  frequently. Your  implementation  has  to support  searches  on either student ID or age. The  major  interfaces  provided  by  your  code should include createDataSet, destroyDataSet, searchAge, searchID, insertion, deletion, maxAgeGap.
