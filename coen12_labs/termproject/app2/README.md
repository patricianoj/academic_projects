Assignment:

Consider a college holding records about its students, where each record contains two integer fields: ID and Age. Identify the most appropriate data structuresso that the Big-O run time forfrequent operations is optimized.

Assume  that  the  college  takes  very  few  transfer  students  and  has  most  of  its  students  stay  for  at  least  one  year (Hints: no  frequent insertion  and  deletion  operations). And  the  maximum  student  number  is  given. But  it  does require  a  lot  of  search  operations.  Specifically, all  of  thesearchesare  based  on  student IDs.The  major  interfaces provided by your code should include createDataSet, destroyDataSet, searchID, insertion, deletion.
